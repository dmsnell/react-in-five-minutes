# React in five minutes

This doesn't _actually_ get you going with **React** in five minutes if you start from scratch, but you can get there in twenty for sure!

## How to run this code

Clone the repository, then run the following standard **npm** commands...

```bash
npm install
npm run
```

A live-editing environment should open up at `localhost:4001` and you can open that in your browser and start to mess with the code. As you make changes, you should notice almost immediate updates in the browser. If something doesn't reload properly, simply refresh the browser.
